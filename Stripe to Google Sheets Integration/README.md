# Stripe to Google Sheets Integration

This project aims to develop a system that retrieves data from a user's Stripe account using the Stripe API and writes it to a Google Sheet in a tabular format. By integrating Stripe and Google Sheets, users can conveniently manage and analyze their Stripe transactions within a familiar spreadsheet environment. The system will authenticate users, retrieve Stripe data using the Stripe API, and utilize the Google Sheets API to update the user's Google Sheet. It will provide data synchronization, error handling, configuration options, and a user-friendly interface for seamless management of Stripe data.
